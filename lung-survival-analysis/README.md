# Lung Cancer Survival Analysis (Kaplan–Meier & Cox Proportional Hazards)

This project performs a biostatistical survival analysis using the `lung` dataset from the **survival** package in R. The analysis evaluates time-to-event outcomes in patients with advanced lung cancer using Kaplan–Meier curves, log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards models, and proportional hazards diagnostics.

## 📌 Objectives

- Estimate survival probabilities using **Kaplan–Meier curves**
- Compare survival between patient groups (sex, age categories)
- Fit and interpret a **Cox proportional hazards model**
- Evaluate hazard ratios (HR) and their confidence intervals
- Test the **proportional hazards assumption** using Schoenfeld residuals

---

## 🧪 Methods Used

### **1. Kaplan–Meier Survival Estimation**
- Created survival objects using `Surv()`
- Estimated curves using `survfit()`
- Compared groups using log-rank tests
- Visualized curves with confidence intervals and risk tables

### **2. Cox Proportional Hazards Modeling**
- Modeled the effect of sex and age on survival time
- Interpreted hazard ratios using `broom::tidy()`
- Evaluated statistical significance and confidence intervals

### **3. PH Assumption Check**
- Used `cox.zph()` to test the proportional hazards assumption
- Visualized residuals using `ggcoxzph()`

## 📈 Key Findings (Example Interpretation)

- **Sex differences:**  
  Kaplan–Meier curves typically show survival differences between males and females, supported by log-rank test p-values.

- **Age impact:**  
  Older patients often have higher hazard (shorter survival), reflected by HR > 1 in the Cox model.

- **Model validity:**  
  Schoenfeld residuals often indicate no major violations of the proportional hazards assumption.
